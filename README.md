# dmx-controller
Self-made open source dmx controller using off the shelf components.


In 2019 I started developing a self-made, Arduino based, dmx controller for some Chinese LED PAR lights.
The project updated 4 times. From a wooden case to a plastic tabletop case with an aluminium plate.
While changing the hardware, the software changed multiple times too.

The third iteration of my project consists of an Arduino Mega, which I described in the branch "version 1". 
The currently final iteration consists of a much faster Teensy 3.2.
This is described in the branch "version 2".

The code is not that professional, but it works for me.
Further details are listed in the separate branches of this repository.



The current program files "dmx_send_20.4.ino" and "effects.h" are uploaded in this repository. For further informations visit the corresponding branches.
